"""Minimal gaps-only environment for the reach-avoid gap experiment.

A single gap per patch (flat approach -> gap -> flat landing), gap width
spanning clearly-jumpable to clearly-uncrossable.  Goal behaviors:
  * large gap, not yet jumped -> stop before the edge,
  * small gap -> jump across,
  * already crossed -> stop or continue forward.

This is the **privileged-actor** first pass: the actor sees proprioception
*including* the raycast ``height_scan`` (so the gap geometry is directly
observable), and the depth camera is dropped for speed.  A later pass can swap
to a depth-only actor for deployability.

Key choices (see chat rationale):
  * Reach margin ``l`` = *foothold support* (handled by the gap wrapper), so
    "safely stopped before an uncrossable gap" is itself a target state and the
    policy learns to stop rather than launch.
  * No distance-curriculum; ``randomize_terrain`` re-rolls the gap width each
    reset so the policy faces the full width distribution from the start.
  * Init sampling places the robot before / over (slightly elevated) / after the
    gap with varied pose + velocity spanning recoverable and unrecoverable
    flight states.
